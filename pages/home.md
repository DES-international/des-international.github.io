### Vision

Enable research that contributes to novel discoveries and addresses global societal challenges.

### Mission

Enable the coordination of a globally integrated network of stakeholders to realize an extensible technical and social infrastructures of data, tools, and working practices in support of our vision.

### Who we are

We are an international group of event- and collection-based biodiversity scientists, infrastructure providers and biodiversity informaticians from five continents with advanced expertise and long-term experience in developing and interconnecting social and technical networks. 

who are interested in interlinking existing major regional biodiversity data infrastructures based on the [Digital Extended Specimen](https://doi.org/10.1093/biosci/biac060) concept (DES).

### Stakeholders

### Roadmap

#### Unique capacity

We are a global network of stakeholders that works towards an extensible technical and social infrastructures of data, tools, and working practices to bring together ongoing research and collaboration for the realization of a DES Network. 

Located on already five continents our goal is to facilitate the initiation of a globally integrated backbone that makes community participation possible and can be continuously extened with the goal of aligning research needs and information to address global societal challenges.


#### The problem

* Siloed biodiversity infrastructures and data
* Limited scope of funding, e.g. focuses on short-term projects, national to regional partners, etc.
  * Prototype development versus robust operation under global real-world conditions 
  * Limited coordination and alignment in standards & practices among existing global biodiversity data initiatives.
* Global community buy-in
  * lack of attribution
  * limited options for participation in decision-making
  * lack of data governance
* Demands of scaling up 
  * harmonizing and integrating transdisciplinary data and
  * interconnecting and communicating at the global level
* Bilateral Access and Benefit Sharing procedures in multinational projects


#### Solutions
