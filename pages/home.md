### Vision

Enable research that contributes to novel discoveries and addresses global societal challenges.

### Mission

Enable the coordination of a globally integrated network of stakeholders to realize an extensible technical and social infrastructures of data, tools, and working practices in support of our vision.

### Who we are

We are an international group of event- and collection-based biodiversity scientists, infrastructure providers and biodiversity informaticians from five continents with advanced expertise who are interested in interlinking existing major regional biodiversity data infrastructures based on the Digital Extended Specimen concept (DES).

### Stakeholders


### Roadmap

#### Unique capacity

We are a global network of stakeholders that works towards an extensible technical and social infrastructures of data, tools, and working practices to bring together ongoing research and collaboration for the realization of a DES Network. 

Located on five continents our goal is to facilitate the initiation of a globally integrated backbone that makes community participation possible and can be continuously extened with the goal of aligning research needs and information to address global societal challenges.
