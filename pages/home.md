### Vision

Enable research that contributes to novel discoveries and addresses global societal challenges.

### Mission

Enable the coordination of a globally integrated network of stakeholders to realize an extensible technical and social infrastructures of data, tools, and working practices in support of our vision.

### Who we are

We are an international group of event- and collection-based biodiversity scientists, infrastructure providers and biodiversity informaticians from five continents with advanced expertise and long-term experience in developing and interconnecting social and technical networks. 

who are interested in interlinking existing major regional biodiversity data infrastructures based on the [Digital Extended Specimen](https://doi.org/10.1093/biosci/biac060) concept (DES).

### Stakeholders

### Roadmap

#### Unique capacity

We are a global network of stakeholders that works towards an extensible technical and social infrastructures of data, tools, and working practices to bring together ongoing research and collaboration for the realization of a DES Network. 

Located on already five continents our goal is to facilitate the initiation of a globally integrated backbone that makes community participation possible and can be continuously extened with the goal of aligning research needs and information to address global societal challenges.


#### The problem

* Siloed biodiversity infrastructures and data
  * Much research derivative data is siloed and not discoverable or open
  * No standardized and widely used globally unique persistant and resolvable identifiers to interlink primary biodiversity data, derived data and associated data
  * Digital derivatives related to natural science collection objects not linked
  * Identifiers used inconsistently or not at all to enable links
* Limited scope of funding, e.g. focuses on short-term projects, national to regional partners, etc.
  * Prototype development versus robust operation under global real-world conditions 
  * Limited coordination and alignment in standards & practices among existing global biodiversity data initiatives.
* Global community buy-in
  * lack of attribution
  * limited options for participation in decision-making
  * lack of data governance
  * Community social change required
* Demands of scaling up 
  * harmonizing and integrating transdisciplinary data and
  * interconnecting and communicating at the global level
* Bilateral Access and Benefit Sharing procedures in multinational projects



#### Solutions

* Umbrella to support discussions and growth of social and data structures
* Sustained funding
* Support for existing infrastructure (e.g., alliance) or develop new one
* A global community of practice that incorporates FAIR & CARE principles to build an integrated data network.
* Support and movement: community, policy-makers, interfaces /w others
* Show growth potential, i.e. by snowballing
* A vehicle for discussion and experimentation
* transactional backbone
* data governance
* distributed, federated
* Community focus and capacity development


#### Metrics

* Growth of network of data users
* Growth of databases and networked databases
* Use in the GBF: the number of goals & targets, indicator dev.
* Number & roles of active Global South indiv & orgs, diversity distrib.
* Active regional/ nat. data centers
* Permanent growth in human resources
* Nature capital growth
* Contributions to ABS: indicators, non-monetary contributions/benefits shared
* Participators - whether as commenters, proposers of use cases, evangelists
* Increase the BUS factor - would DES idea live on if we all disappeared?
* Seeding the term use of DES idea /aims in grants & publications
* Demonstrated data aggregation of extended data and data returning to origin
* Minted and used UUIDs for all objects
* Example backbone in place
* Adoption and implementation of backbone architecture
* Fully funded action center providing infrastructure and other needs to support
* Number of links generated
* Annotations by source
* Publication of data/links
